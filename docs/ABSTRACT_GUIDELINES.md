## Plagiarism Prevention

### What Counts as Plagiarism?
- Copying code without attribution
- Using entire libraries without citation
- Copying documentation from other sources
- Reusing project reports without acknowledgment
- Misrepresenting others' work as your own

### How to Avoid Plagiarism
1. **Write Original Code:** Implement algorithms yourself
2. **Cite Libraries:** Reference all external libraries used
3. **Document Sources:** Keep track of all references
4. **Use Quotes:** When using external text, use quotation marks
5. **Paraphrase Properly:** Understand and rewrite in your own words
6. **Run Plagiarism Check:** Use institutional plagiarism detection tools

### Acceptable vs. Unacceptable

**✓ ACCEPTABLE:**
- Using standard libraries (NumPy, PIL) with citation
- Implementing algorithms from research papers with citation
- Following coding standards and best practices
- Learning from tutorials and adapting to your context
- Getting guidance from supervisors and peers

**✗ UNACCEPTABLE:**
- Copying entire code blocks from GitHub
- Using code generators without understanding
- Submitting someone else's project with minor changes
- Not citing sources of algorithms or techniques
- Copying documentation from other projects

## AI-Generated Content Policy (0% Tolerance)

### Why 0% Tolerance?
The institute requires that you demonstrate:
- Understanding of all code you submit
- Ability to explain design decisions
- Knowledge of underlying algorithms
- Debugging and problem-solving skills

### Verification Methods
You may be asked to:
- Explain any section of your code
- Make modifications to demonstrate understanding
- Answer questions about implementation details
- Defend design choices
- Debug issues in front of evaluators

### Permitted Use of AI Tools
**Only for Learning/Reference:**
- Understanding concepts (not code generation)
- Learning syntax of programming languages
- General research and literature review
- Debugging assistance (understanding errors)

**NOT Permitted:**
- Generating code to be submitted
- AI writing documentation
- Completing assignments/tasks
- Creating algorithms or functions

### How to Prove Your Work is Original

1. **Maintain Development Logs:**
   - Keep notes of your development process
   - Document decisions and iterations
   - Save versions showing progression

2. **Version Control:**
   - Use Git with regular commits
   - Commit messages showing thought process
   - History showing incremental development

3. **Documentation:**
   - Write comments explaining your logic
   - Document design decisions
   - Keep research notes

4. **Be Prepared to Defend:**
   - Understand every line of code
   - Explain algorithm choices
   - Demonstrate modifications live

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q1: Can I work on this project during an internship?
**A:** Only if the work is research-based and NOT just a simple internship. You must clearly distinguish between internship tasks and your major project research.

### Q2: Can I have an industry mentor?
**A:** Yes, but as an EXTERNAL co-guide only. Your MAIN supervisor must be from the institute.

### Q3: What if I use external libraries?
**A:** That's acceptable, but you must:
- Cite them properly in references
- Explain why you chose them
- Demonstrate understanding of how they work
- Implement custom logic on top of them

### Q4: Can I use code from online tutorials?
**A:** Learning from tutorials is fine, but:
- Don't copy-paste entire solutions
- Understand and adapt to your context
- Cite sources if directly influenced
- Write original implementations

### Q5: How do I prove plagiarism is <10%?
**A:** Run your work through institutional plagiarism detection tools like:
- Turnitin
- iThenticate
- Urkund

Keep the report as proof.

### Q6: What about AI coding assistants?
**A:** 0% tolerance means:
- Don't use them to generate code
- Only use for learning concepts
- You must write all code yourself
- Be prepared to prove understanding

### Q7: Can I collaborate with classmates?
**A:** Each student must submit an INDIVIDUAL project. While you can discuss concepts:
- Write your own code
- Conduct your own research
