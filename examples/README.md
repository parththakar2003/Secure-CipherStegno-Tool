# Example Files

This directory contains sample files for testing the Secure CipherStegno Tool.

## Files

- `sample_message.txt` - Sample text message for encryption/steganography
- `test_image.png` - Sample cover image (to be added by user)
- `test_audio.wav` - Sample audio file (to be added by user)

## Usage

1. Add your own test images (PNG or BMP format) for image steganography
2. Add your own test audio files (WAV format) for audio steganography
3. Use the sample message or create your own

## Notes

- For best results with image steganography, use PNG format (lossless)
- For audio steganography, use uncompressed WAV files
- Larger cover files allow for longer hidden messages
